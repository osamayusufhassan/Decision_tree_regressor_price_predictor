# Home Price Estimator
• Problem Statement: A real estate agent wants to understand the pricing criteria of homes built in a certain locality. Create a model to estimate the home prices based upon a number of features as shown in the data set.<br />
• Skills Accomplished: Python, sci-kit learn (DecisionTreeRegressor, train_test_split, mean_absolute_error), pandas, numpy, Model Validation using Mean Absolute Error metric.<br />
• Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook for Python, Microsoft Excel.<br />
• Built and trained a model to estimate home prices via Decision Tree Regressor of sci-kit learn library.<br />
• Performed model validation and handled overfitting vs underfitting to minimize mean absolute error.<br />
